"Design and develop a world-class Retail Billing System application using Supabase (PostgreSQL) as the backend database and platform. The solution must leverage Supabase features such as hosted PostgreSQL database, authentication, row-level security, and auto-generated APIs to build a secure, scalable, cloud-based system.
​

Core Requirements
Database Design (PostgreSQL on Supabase):

Design a fully normalized schema (up to 3NF) for a retail billing system with entities like products, customers, users, bills, bill_items, suppliers, and payments.

Use appropriate data types, constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK), and indexing strategies to ensure integrity and performance.
​

Supabase Authentication & Roles:

Use Supabase Auth to manage application users (admin, manager, cashier) with secure email/password login.

Map authenticated users to a users table in the database and use Row Level Security (RLS) policies to restrict access based on role and ownership where appropriate.
​

Retail Billing Features:

Product Management: Add, edit, delete, and list products with fields such as Product ID, name, category, barcode/SKU, stock quantity, purchase price, selling price, tax rate, supplier, and optional expiry date.

Customer Management: Store customers with Customer ID, name, phone, email, loyalty points, and basic demographics; track association with past bills.

Billing / POS Module:

Create new bills by scanning/entering product codes, auto-fetching prices and tax.

Support discounts (percentage and flat), tax calculation (GST/VAT), and multiple payment modes (cash, UPI/card, wallet).

On bill completion, automatically update inventory stock and store an itemized bill in the database.

Invoice Generation: Generate a unique bill number, date/time, line items, subtotal, tax, discount, and grand total; provide a printable or downloadable layout (PDF or HTML).

Security with Row Level Security (RLS):

Enable RLS on all sensitive tables and define policies such that:

Cashiers can only view and create bills, but not modify master data like products and suppliers.

Managers/admins can view analytics, manage products, suppliers, and users.

Use Supabase’s policy system with auth.uid() to reference the logged-in user in security rules.
​

Analytics & Reports:

Implement SQL queries and API endpoints for:

Daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports.

Top-selling products.

Low-stock alert report (products below threshold).

Customer-wise purchase summary and high-value customers.

Optionally use Supabase real-time features to reflect new sales and stock changes live on a dashboard.
​

Tech Stack & Architecture:

Use Supabase as the backend (database, auth, APIs, RLS) and choose any modern frontend stack such as React, Next.js, or simple HTML/JS for the client.
​

Interact with Supabase via its JavaScript client or REST APIs for CRUD operations on all core entities.

Follow a clean architecture (modular services, clear separation of UI logic and data-access layer).

Deliverables (DBMS course focus):

ER Diagram for the full schema, showing all entities and relationships with cardinalities.

SQL schema script (PostgreSQL) that can be executed in Supabase SQL editor to recreate all tables, constraints, indexes, and RLS policies.
​

Sample data script to populate products, customers, and sample sales for demonstration.

Application source code with clear documentation on how it connects to Supabase (environment variables, client initialization, etc.).

Project report explaining database design, normalization, key SQL queries, RLS policies, and screenshots of the working app and dashboards.

Goal: Build a professional-grade, secure, cloud-based Retail Billing System that demonstrates strong database design principles using Supabase’s managed PostgreSQL, suitable as a flagship DBMS course project and realistically deployable for a small or medium retail store."
